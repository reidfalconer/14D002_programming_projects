# 14D002: Deterministic Models and Optimization

## Programming Projects:

### **Edit distance**

We design an algorithm that, given two strings X and Y, computes the edit distance between X and Y. Furthermore, the algorithm  provides one with the optimal sequence of operations required to transform X into Y.

### **Huffman codes**

Here we build two algorithms:
1. An algorithm that, when given an input text T, constructs an optimal prefix code for T.
2. An algorithm that, given a prefix code for a text T, outputs T.
